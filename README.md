# Barnacle

*Your mods, firmly encrusted* 🐚🌊

Barnacle is a fast, powerful mod manager for Linux.

## Features

* Mods are deployed via [OverlayFS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OverlayFS) to keep your game directory clean with negligible overhead. 

## Requirements

Linux ≥ 5.11 is required, as it’s the first release with rootless OverlayFS.
