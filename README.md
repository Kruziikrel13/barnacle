# Barnacle

*Your mods, firmly encrusted* 🐚🌊

Barnacle is a fast, powerful mod manager for Linux.

## AI Acknowledgement

For full transparency, AI was used for intial architecture brainstorming (until I realized it wasn't actually that useful), reviewing PRs with Copilot, and DeepWiki. None of the code in Barnacle was vibecoded, and clearly vibecoded PRs will not be accepted.
